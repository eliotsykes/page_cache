CHANGELOG
---------

2010-05-10
- Added :ttl and :block_leaked_requests options to cached_pages.
- Introduced concept of "leaked requests" which is what happens when requests
  that you want to be served by the Apache+cached-file sporadically get through
  to the Rails app.
- Removed lock file optimization from rake page_cache:update task as this does
  not work with :ttl option.

2010-04-20
- Sometimes requests are getting thorough to the Rails application for pages
  that are cached and served statically by Apache. Unsure as to why this happens
  though it coincides with when the rake page_cache:update task runs, so probably
  something to do with overwriting a file in the 'live' cache directory that
  Apache is simultaneously trying to serve.  Perhaps this writing operation is
  not atomic. Anyway, rather than risk spending too much time investigating
  I've decided to change the behaviour to write a warning to the Rails log
  file when this happens, instead of raising an exception that bubbles up to the
  user. In this way the cached page will be served dynamically while the static
  file is unavailable, although this defeats one of the main advantages of the
  plugin over the standard Rails page cache behaviour.
